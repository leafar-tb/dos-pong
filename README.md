# dos-pong
Just a simple pong clone for DOS(Box). Use 'w' for up and 's' for down. The right player is the computer (and probably too strong).

You can buid it yourself with *make* and GCC or use the precompiled [exe](https://github.com/leafar-tb/dos-pong/raw/master/pong.exe).
The neat trick to get GCC to build for DOS I found [here](http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/12/09/).
